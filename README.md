## Overview
Each year between July and September brown bears in the Katmai National Park congregate along the Brooks River.  This river is one of the main rivers that Sockeye Salmon swim up to spawn.  The brown bears wait in the shallows of the river and catch the salmon as they jump over rocks.  Want to see it in [ACTION](https://explore.org/livecams/brown-bears/brown-bear-salmon-cam-brooks-falls)? This simple web applications allows the user to track the bears of Katmai National Park. The user can name a bear and add an image of the bear, which will display on cards in the bear den.
